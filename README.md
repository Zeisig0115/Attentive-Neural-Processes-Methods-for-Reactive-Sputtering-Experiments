# Attentive-Neural-Processes-Methods-for-Reactive-Sputtering-Experiments
This is a repo for the implementation of using attentive neural process (ANP) models for reactive sputtering data

This project is based on the study [Deep neural network and meta-learning-based reactive sputtering with small data sample counts] by [Jeongsu Lee and Chanwoo Yang], published in [Journal of Manufacturing Systems]. The work provides insights into reactive sputtering processes and has been foundational in developing machine learning models for predicting deposition outcomes. We outperformed this work by applying attentive neural process methods.

The data is in the **Supplementary material** of the paper available at: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027861252200019X?via%3Dihub#sec0060
