# Attentive-Neural-Processes-Methods-for-Reactive-Sputtering-Experiments
**[MLPs]**: Some experimental data for performance comparison between using two independent MLPs for extracting Key/Query for cross-attention and using one MLP for both Key/Query.
**[sigma]**: Some experimental data for reparameterization of sigma in the latent encoder and decoder.

This project is based on the study [Deep neural network and meta-learning-based reactive sputtering with small data sample counts] by [Jeongsu Lee and Chanwoo Yang], published in [Journal of Manufacturing Systems]. The work provides insights into reactive sputtering processes and has been foundational in developing machine learning models for predicting deposition outcomes. We outperformed this work by applying attentive neural process methods.
